**Nelson Mandela** has said:
> "It always seems impossible until it's done."

**This quote motivates me that everything is possible and I should not put my self down in anyway. I should never give up and constantly try again and again until I completee my goal.**


**My favorite piece of code is**
```
clear
```
This is because it cleans and gets rid of all the commands in the terminal and I can start fresh
