# Hi My Name is Mohammed Master!
## Who am I?
*I am a third year student and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am from Los Angeles, California and have a lot of hobbies. I love to play sports such as basketball and football. I also like to build and work on cars.*
My favorite car at the moment is the [BMW M3 CS](https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/m-models/m3-sedan/overview.html).


**I look forward to being in this class**
**Nelson Mandela** has said:
> "It always seems impossible until it's done."
**This quote motivates me that everything is possible and I should not put my self down in anyway.**


**My favorite piece of code is**
```
clear
```
**This is because it cleans and gets rid of all the commands in the terminal.**
