**Nelson Mandela** has said:
> "It always seems impossible until it's done."

This quote motivates me that everything is possible and I should not put my self down in anyway. I should never give up and constantly try again and again until I completee my goal.


**My favorite piece of code is**
```
clear
```
This is because it cleans and gets rid of all the commands in the terminal and I can start fresh

I do not have much experience programming in the job force but I have worked many other jobs. This is my [resume](110resume.pdf) and here you can find thee classes that I have taken and the jobs that I have worked for.
